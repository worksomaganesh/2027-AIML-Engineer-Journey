# Chronological Learning Order — 202X

**Mission:** earn one genuine first-year internship by **31 March 2027**.  
**Start date:** 1 November 2026, after mid-examinations.  
**Study capacity:** approximately 20–22 hours/week.  
**Stretch checkpoint:** 18–24 January. **Main portfolio-ready checkpoint:** 1–7 February.

This file answers: **what do I learn first, what comes next, and when do I use it in a project?**

The sequence is narrower than the full repository. Folder names are a long-term knowledge map; they are not a promise to master every topic before March. Learn a topic, practise it, use it, and record what you actually completed.

## The learning order at a glance

1. Python basics + Git/GitHub setup
2. Python control flow and built-in collections
3. Python functions, modules, files, exceptions and debugging
4. Project 00: GitHub Foundation + Project 01: Smart File Log Analyzer
5. Linux/terminal essentials + testing basics
6. SQL fundamentals and relational-table thinking
7. SQL joins + pandas/NumPy essentials
8. Data cleaning, EDA, charts and practical statistics
9. Project 02: E-commerce Business Analytics
10. ML fundamentals, train/test split and baseline models
11. scikit-learn, preprocessing and honest model evaluation
12. HTTP/JSON, REST, FastAPI, Pydantic and database CRUD
13. pytest/API testing + a simple demo or deployment
14. LLM API, prompting, structured output and error handling
15. Embeddings, vector retrieval and basic RAG (small scope)
16. Project 03/04 polish, documentation, resume and interview practice
17. February–March: applications, assessments, interviews and targeted gap-filling

**In parallel from Week 2:** practise DSA for about 2–3 hours/week and keep checking/applying to eligible internships as soon as you have credible evidence. Do not postpone applications until every item is finished.

## Chronological schedule

**Deliverable:** reproducible ML Prediction Project with a baseline comparison, suitable metrics, error analysis and honest limitations.

### Phase 10 — DSA + basic software engineering
**3–9 January; DSA stays parallel until interviews**

DSA order:
1. Big-O, arrays/strings and hash maps/sets.
2. Sorting and binary search.
3. Two pointers and sliding window.
4. Stack and queue; linked-list concepts.
5. Recursion basics, tree traversal and BFS/DFS concepts if time remains.

Aim for **25–35 understood practice problems by February**, not a high count of copied solutions. Do a few each week rather than leaving DSA to the end.

Other learning: HTTP, methods/status codes, JSON request/response, SQL parameterisation and safe configuration basics.

**Repo:** relevant 02-DSA folders; 04-Web-Backend/http, json and rest.

**Deliverable:** explain selected DSA solutions aloud and write basic HTTP/JSON examples.

### Phase 11 — Backend API + testing
**10–16 January**
1. FastAPI route and request/response basics.
2. Pydantic request/response validation.
3. REST endpoints and CRUD concepts.
4. Connect to SQLite first; use PostgreSQL only if the project needs it.
5. Useful status codes and errors; avoid unsafe SQL string interpolation.
6. pytest assertions, edge cases, basic API tests and Postman manual checks.
7. Environment variables and .env exclusion from Git; simple deployment only if it does not distract.

**Repo:** 04-Web-Backend/fastapi, pydantic, rest, crud, postgresql, error-handling, postman; 09-Testing/pytest, api-testing, edge-cases; 08-Linux/environment-variables.

**Deliverable:** small API with validation and happy-path/invalid-input tests, plus working setup instructions. Serve the ML project through it only if useful.

### Phase 12 — LLM API and structured output
**17–23 January**
1. Call one hosted LLM API; read its documentation and understand basic costs/limits.
2. Prompt structure: task, context, constraints and output format.
3. Handle API failures, timeouts and malformed responses.
4. Request structured output and validate it with a schema.
5. Keep keys in environment variables; never commit secrets.
6. Evaluate normal, ambiguous and unsupported inputs.

**Repo:** 06-Generative-AI/api-integration, prompting, llms, structured-output.

**Deliverable:** Job Description Analyzer MVP that extracts skills/requirements and distinguishes quoted source text from model-generated suggestions. **18–24 January is a stretch checkpoint**, not a reason to claim unfinished work is done.

### Phase 13 — Minimal retrieval/RAG, only after the app works
**24–30 January**
1. What embeddings represent at a high level.
2. Split text into chunks and retrieve relevant chunks.
3. Basic vector/similarity search and top-k retrieval.
4. Show source snippets and test unanswerable questions.
5. State that retrieval does not guarantee factual answers.
6. Skip complex agents, fine-tuning and advanced vector databases.

**Repo:** 06-Generative-AI/embeddings, vector-search, rag, experiments.

**Deliverable:** add a small source-grounded retrieval feature only if the core project already works. If behind schedule, skip RAG and polish the reliable version.

### Phase 14 — Finish the portfolio and prepare for interviews
**31 January–7 February**
1. Run each project from a clean environment; fix broken setup steps.
2. Add clear READMEs, examples, tests, limitations and optional screenshots/demo.
3. Polish at least **three** projects; the fourth may remain a smaller MVP.
4. Make a truthful one-page resume and role-specific variants.
5. Update LinkedIn/GitHub profile and practise 60–90 second project explanations.
6. Practise Python, SQL, DSA, debugging, basic CS and communication questions.
7. Submit tailored applications while polishing.

**Repo:** 10-Projects; 13-Internships/preparation/resume and interview-prep; 17-Progress.

**Readiness rule:** 1–7 February is the main target, not a guarantee. If behind, cut optional RAG, HTML/CSS polish, advanced ML and Category 4 topics first. Keep applications running.

### Phase 15 — February and March: apply, interview, adapt
**8 February–31 March**
1. Search current official postings and verify first-year eligibility/work conditions.
2. Tailor applications to evidence already in the repository.
3. Practise assessments/interview topics that actually appear in target roles.
4. Record applications, assessments, replies, interviews, rejections and follow-ups.
5. After roughly 20 well-matched applications with little response, review eligibility, resume fit, project proof and outreach quality.
6. Continue learning only the gaps that are blocking real applications/interviews.

**Deadline:** 31 March 2027. An offer cannot be guaranteed; the plan aims to maximise preparation and leave room for obstacles.

## Parallel tracks — do not leave these until the end

### DSA — 2–3 hours/week from Week 2
Keep a consistent practice block. Progress from arrays/strings/hash maps to binary search, two pointers, sliding window, stacks/queues, recursion and basic tree/graph traversal. Increase time if target postings use coding assessments.

### Applications — research from November; submit when evidence is credible
- November: research roles, eligibility and scam signals; track live postings.
- Late November/December: apply to roles you qualify for once Project 01 and a truthful resume are presentable.
- January–March: keep applying while learning; never wait until “100% ready”.

### Documentation — throughout
After each session, record what was attempted, what worked, what failed and the next step in 16-Daily-Log. Update 17-Progress weekly. The repository should reflect actual progress, not planned progress written as if completed.

## Weekly study pattern

- **Monday–Friday (2h/day):** 75–90 minutes learning/coding the main skill; remaining time for exercises, a small DSA problem or project integration.
- **Saturday (5–6h):** project implementation, debugging and tests.
- **Sunday (5–6h):** practise/revise, document the week, review role openings and plan next week's top three tasks.
- Keep a buffer block for college work or unexpected obstacles. If exams/assignments spike, protect consistency instead of trying to compensate with an unsustainable all-nighter.
